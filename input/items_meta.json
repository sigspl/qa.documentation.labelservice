Web application mashups integrate heterogeneous data, application logic, and UI components (widgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherent and value-adding composite applications. They are targeted at leveraging the \"long tail\" of the Web of Services (a.k.a. the Programmable Web) by exploiting rapid development, DIY, and shareability. They typically serve a specific situational (i.e. immediate, short-lived, customized) need, frequently with high potential for reuse. Is this \"situational\" character which precludes them to be offered as 'off-the-shelf' functionality by solution providers, and therefore creates the need for a tool like Wirecloud \n\n Note:  Wirecloud is at the core of the FIWARE infrastructure and is therefore intended to be installed by FIWARE platform providers when setting up a configuring a new instance of the FIWARE instance node. It is not intended to be deployed/configured by a developer. Developers are encouraged to use  the global instance of Wirecloud provided in the FIWARE Lab . Nevertheless, we provide an installer for stand-alone instances of Wirecloud, along with recipes and blueprints to install it in the Cloud portal (using the PaaS Manager), and the corresponding installation guides. \n\n Why to get it \n\n Web application mashups can be manually developed using conventional web programming technologies (e.g. see http://programmableweb.com). But this fails to take full advantage of the approach. Mashup tools and platforms like Wirecloud aim at development  paradigms that do not require programming skills  and, hence, target end users, being them citizens, knowledge workers, portal designers, etc. \n\n By using Wirecloud you have access to the following key features: \n\n \n Innovate through experimentation by choosing the best suited widgets, operators and prefab mashup-lets for your devised mashup from a vast, ever-growing distributed catalogue  \n\n The wiring editor allows you to easily connect widgets in a mashup to create a full-fledged dashboard with RIA functionality \n\n The piping editor allows you to easily connect widgets to back-end services or data sources through an extendable set of operators, including filters, aggregators, adapters, etc. \n\n Share your newly created mashup with other colleagues and users. Comment it, tag it and rate it to foster discoverability and shareability \n\n Help to build a strong community by commenting, tagging and rating others' widgets, operators and mashups.

Location information, lighting information, device orientation, heading direction are the necessary contextual information and based on the service these other information available to the browser can be used. Air pressure, time the image is taken are some of the available important meta data can also be used as \"Tagging content\". Tagging can be similar to the contemparary geo tagging but highly dependent on the image format (JPEG, PNG, ogg, wmv, ect....). Exif extension method can be used if the format used is JPEG and for image formats such as PNG another method can be used. Format of the image in image capture depends on the usage scenario. For example in a situation where image processing is minimal JPEG compresssion can be better over PNG lossless images. \n\n Why to get it \n\nPhotos taken from devices combined with the meta data shown as Tag are transferred to the 2D3D capture server. 2D 3D capture server API then can be used to dig up image based on time, location for use of other applications where 2D or 3D visual information is required. In the use case described here 3D scene builder can be a part of other GEs such as POI. Another use case is, using tagged images published by other services or devices such as Flickr to build a 3d model of the current location so that a person such as lost tourist could find his way. Elaborating on the \"Tag\" and its content, images are geo-tagged in order to improve the user experience in social networks images. 3D information can be used similarly to improve the quality of the user experience and meta data that can be associated with a model improves number of use cases 3d modelling can be used. Most importantly information such as orientation of the device at the moment which the photo is taken can be used to improve the accuracy and it also helps to filter out less useful images from the useful once. In a hypothetical security situation where two images taken from known locations by two security cameras at the same time could be useful in identifying a criminal who happened to be at that location. By using meta data such as lighting conditions the accuracy of the 3d model of the criminal can be improved and will avoid innocent being targeted. \n\n Open specification reference \nThis component has been designed according the  2D/3D Capture GE Open Specification .", "enabler": "2D/3D Capture", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:       3.2.3      \n        Updated:       2016-08-31      \n        Contact Person:       Cyberlightning      \n            contact@cyberlightning.com      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

The services provided, even if they can be used in isolation offer their most when used conjointly to cover the whole & primary usage pattern. Hereafter is the list of services offered by the Security Monitoring  \n \n MulVAL Attack Paths Engine \n Scored Attack Paths \n Remediation \n \n\n MulVAL Attack Paths Engine \nMulVAL Attack Paths Engine Component is an end-to-end framework and reasoning system that conducts multihost, multistage vulnerability analysis on a network.   MulVAL Attack Paths Engine is accessed using web browser, allowing all users  to generate the attack graphs using the common stream protocol and port (HTTP on port 80).\nAttack graph presents a qualitative view of security discrepancies:\n \n It shows what attacks are possible, but does not tell you how bad the problem is. \n It captures the interactions among all attack possibilities in your system. \n \n\n\n \n\n Scored Attack Paths \nScored Attack Paths represents the next step, following the metrics provided by the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine. Based on the Attack Graph provided by the Mulval Attack Paths Engine, and the individual scores of each step, the objective is to yield the possible attack paths, along with a score associated to each one of the paths.\n\nThe considered attack paths that will be included in the list are selected based on the target node selected in the attack graph. The score of each path reflects the risk associated to the path as a whole, based on the individual scores of each step that have been previously calculated by the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine.\n\nAdditionally to the risk score metric, the score of each path will include a second scoring component that will account for the impact on the processes linked to the IT resource(s) being either\n \n solely at the target node of the attack path \n on the attack path \n \n\nThe main idea of scoring attack paths is to consider paths independently from one another, as opposed to the approach of the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine, composed of individual scores, the latter being computed by taking into account all the connections existing in the attack graph. \n\n\n\n \n\n Remediation \nRemediation provides tools to security operators for proposing cost-sensitive remediations to attack paths.\n\nThe attack paths are shown to a security operator, ordered by their scores, which allow to easily understand the severity of the consequences of the attack paths. To calculate the remediation to the chosen attack path, the tool first extracts the necessary information from the attack path to be corrected. Then, it computes several lists of remediations that could reduce / cut this attack path. Finally, it estimates the cost of each list of remediations and proposes all the lists of remediations, ordered by cost, to security operators. Operators can choose one remediation list and, thanks to the remediation validation, check whether or not the system is more secure after the application of this remediation. \n\nTo compute remediations, a remediation database is needed. It will be external to the GE, as the vulnerability database. This database makes a connection between vulnerabilities (for example thanks to a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier - CVE ID) and a possible adapted remediation. Several types of remediation could be used, for example a patch (it corrects a vulnerability) or a signature of known attacks (it prevents the exploitation of a vulnerability). To build the remediation database, information about patches can be extracted from publicly available in Security Advisories (for example, coming from CERT-EU or the National Vulnerability Database). Information about signatures and the related vulnerability could be extracted from the signatures database that contains the CVE ID. The last type of remediation provided by the remediation tool can not be stored in the remediation database, because it is a topological remediation. This remediation is providing firewall rules that can prevent the intrusion of the attacker.\n\nTo sort the list of remediations, a cost function is applied to compute an estimate cost of each list. This cost contains two main components: operational costs and impact costs. The operational costs represent the costs caused by the deployment of the remediations, such as:\n\n \n Length of the deployment \n Maintenance \n Tests costs \n \n\nwhereas the impact costs represents the negative impact (side effects) that could happen following a remediation deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why to get it \n\nMulVAL Attack Paths Engine is contributing risk management of IT infrastructure.\n\nMuVAL Attack Paths Engine allows you  evaluating the security risk assessment, the potential attack paths and improves the capability to detect security breach and the cyber-resilience of infrastructures.\n\nThe Scored Attack Paths offers an assessment tool that allows users to obtain the attack paths existing in an attack graph, along with their respective individual scores. The score of each attack path allows to assess the risk value and business impact for the target associated to the attack path.\n\nThe Scored Attack Paths is aimed at users who want to either:\n\n \n Utilize the Remediation asset \n Evaluate the situation of their IT infrastructure from the security and business impact viewpoint \n Improve the security configurations through what-if analysis \n \n\nRemediation is aimed at users who want to either:\n\n \n Show attack paths to a security operator \n  Order attack paths by their scores \n Apply a cost function to compute an estimate cost of each list \n \n\n\n Open Specification reference \n\n The Open Specifications of the MulvAL Attack Paths Engine in the context of the Security Monitoring GE can be found via the following links: \n Mulval Attack Paths Engine API Specification \n Mulval Attack Paths Engine  Web Application API Specification \n\n\n The Open Specification of the Scored Attack Paths in the context of the Security Monitoring GE can be found via the following link: \n Scored Attack Paths API Specification \n\n The Open Specification of the Remediation in the context of the Security Monitoring GE can be found via the following link: \n Remediation API Specification \n\n", "enabler": "Security Monitoring", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2015-09-02      \n        Contact Person:       Olivier Bettan / Susana Gonz\u00e1lez Zarzosa      \n            olivier.bettan@thalesgroup.com\nsusana.gzarzosa@atos.net      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

CEP technology is sometimes also referred to as event stream analysis, or real time event correlation.\n \n\n \n   Cepheus  is divided in two simple deployable applications. The first one is a light NGSI broker which features an implementation of  the standardized NGSI API .

It targets IoT gateways and embedded systems.\n \n \n  IoT Data Edge Consolidation GE is the first stage of intelligence, filtering and aggregating sensor events thanks to smart but simple rules. It collects NGSI data in real-time from compliant IoT protocol adapters, transform them to value-added application relevant events, then finally propagate them towards the subscribers. Subscribed applications are now able to collect filtered-relevant real-time data, thus externalizing the responsibility for dedicated development of asynchronous data analysis.

The  IoT Broker  implementation available through the FIWARE Catalogue is the reference implementation of this Generic Enabler by NEC. This implementation satisfies all properties described in the specification of the Generic Enabler.\n\nThe IoT Broker has unique properties that you will not find in other IoT Platforms:\n\n \n  While the IoT Broker GE decouples applications from underlying IoT device installations, it achieves this going far beyond the common publish/subscribe paradigm. Instead, the IoT Broker actively communicates simultaneously with large quantities IoT gateways and devices in order to obtain exactly the information that is required by the running IoT applications. As a result, information only is generated and exchanged when needed. This is in contrast to the state-of-the-art middleware components where any piece of information - whether needed or not - is just ''dumped'' inside a central repository.\n  The IoT Broker has the ability to automatically translate information to the right abstraction level and therefore closes the gap between information-centric applications and device-centric IoT installations. For example, a simple device can typically only deliver values without being aware of the meaning of these values in the application's context. On the other hand, IoT applications have to written without consideration of the device installations in order to be applicable in more than one specific environment. This gap is closed by the IoT Broker by the use of so-called  associations  between device-level and thing-level information.\n \n\nThe IoT Broker Generic Enabler is based on the simple and powerful information model standardized in  OMA Next Generation Service Interface Context Enabler (NGSI 9 / NGSI 10) . This API has emerged in FIWARE as an important open standard of information exchange, implemented by a considerable number of FIWARE GEs. In NGSI 9/10, all objects of the real world, being it sensor/actuator devices or arbitrary objects (like tables, rooms, cars, ...) are represented as so-called Context Entities, while information about these objects is expressed in the form of  attributes .

In order to do this, the user employs the 'Reset current database'.\n\n \n Step 6 \n \nAfter having input the MulVAL file, and loaded the XML database of the file, the user needs to select the normalization method, the score formula, and simply click on the 'Score' button.\n\n \n Manuals  \n  \n A high-level description of the overall architecture of the Scored Attack Paths in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Architecture Description \n The description of the Scored Attack Paths provided in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Scored Attack Paths Description \n\n The provided API of the Scored Attack Paths is specified in the  API Specification \n The installation and administration guide of Scored Attack Paths is provided in the  Installation and Administration Guide \n\n\n \n Tutorials       \n\n\n The user and programmer guide of Scored Attack Paths is provided in the  User and Programmer Guide \n The tutorial to test the Scored Attack Paths is provided in the  Unit Testing Plan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Remediation \n\n Quick reference guide \n\nThe remediation application provides tools to security operators for proposing cost-sensitive remediations to attack paths. This application is written in Java and has a web-interface provided by the Vaadin library. This quick guide explains how to use this web application. \n\n \n Step 1 \n  \nAttack path view:\n\nThe main view contains a representation of the attack path to correct. The first attack path printed is the first ranked (according to the attack paths ranking function). The user can choose another attack path to print in a combo box. The vertices of the attack path have different colours, according to the type of vertex (OR, AND, LEAF or GOAL). The labels of the vertices explain the type of action made by the attacker. A more detailed caption can be found by clicking the \"Show caption\" button under the attack path view. \n\n \n Step 2 \n \nAttack path topologic view:\n\nNext to the attack path view, can be seen a more abstracted and topologic view of the attack path. This view show the different access made by the attacker accross the information system during the attack. This view also show the target machine of the attack and all the compromised machines.\n\n \n Step 3 \n \nRemediation choice:\n\nOn the bottom of the GUI, the security operator can choice several sets of remediation that can correct the attack path. The remediation set with the lower cost is chosen by default, but the operator can choose another one with the appropriate combo-box. To simulate the application of a remediation and its effects on the attack path, the operator can click on the related checkbox and then reset the applied remediations with the button \"Reset remediations\".\n \n \n Manuals  \n  \n A high-level description of the overall architecture of the Remediation in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Architecture Description \n The description of the Remediation provided in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Remediation Description \n The provided API of the Remediation is specified in the  API Specification \n The installation and administration guide of the Remediation is provided in the  Installation and Administration Guide \n\n\n \n Tutorials       \n\n\n The user and programmer guide of the Remediation is provided in the  User and Programmer Guide \n The tutorial to test the Remediation is provided in the  Unit Testing Plan \n\n\n", "enabler": "Security Monitoring", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2015-09-02      \n        Contact Person:       Olivier Bettan / Susana Gonz\u00e1lez Zarzosa      \n            olivier.bettan@thalesgroup.com\nsusana.gzarzosa@atos.net      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/stream-oriented-kurento", "text": "What you get \n\nThe Stream Oriented GE is a development framework that provides an abstraction layer for multimedia capabilities, allowing non-expert developers to include interactive media components to their applications. At the heart of this enabler there is the Open API. A REST-like API, based on JSON RPC 2.0, exposing a toolbox of Media Elements that can be chained to create complex media processing pipelines.\n\nThe Stream Oriented GE provides several client implementations of the Open API. The Java client allows developers to include media capabilities to Java or JEE applications. There is also a Javascript client ready to be used with NodeJS or directly in browser applications.\n\nThanks to these, the Stream Oriented GE provides developers with a set of robust end-to-end interoperable multimedia communication capabilities to deal with the complexity of transport, encoding/decoding, processing and rendering tasks in an easy and efficient way. \n\n Why get it \n\nThe development of interactive multimedia applications is a complex task, which usually requires specific expertise and huge investments. Stream Oriented GE brings a number of abstractions and enablers democratizing multimedia technologies and making possible to any WWW developer to create powerful applications involving advanced features such as: interoperable audiovisual communications, computer vision, augmented reality, flexible media playing, recording, etc.\n\nThe Stream Oriented GE will be particularly useful and intuitive for developers familiar with Java EE and JavaScript technologies, although its capabilities are also exposed through agnostic interoperable network interfaces that can be consumed from any other language of system.\n\nIn a nutshell, It makes possible the development of complex interactive multimedia communications in a fast, simple and easy way.\n\n Open Specifications \n\nKurento is an implementation of the FIWARE  Stream Oriented Generic Enabler  . More specifically, Kurento implements the  Stream Oriented Open API Specification  and provides  Java and Javascript client implementations to access media capabilities \n", "enabler": "Stream-oriented - Kurento", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       6.6.0      \n        Updated:       2016-10-21      \n        Contact Person:       Luis L\u00f3pez      \n            luis.lopez@urjc.es\n      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       5,75 days \n       A+ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,65 response time/thread number \n       B \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       140 Kbps * user \n       C \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory/CPU are slightly increasing but no leak \n       A+ \n     \n   \n \n      "},

Using these interfaces, clients can do several operations:\n\n \n Register context producer applications, e.g. a temperature sensor within a room \n Update context information, e.g. send updates of temperature \n Being notified when changes on context information take place (e.g. the temperature has changed) or with a given frequency (e.g. get the temperature each minute)\n Query context information. The Orion Context Broker stores context information updated from applications, so queries are resolved based on that information.\n \n\nApart from Orion Context Broker, there are other related components that you may find useful, such as Cygnus or Steelskin PEP. Cygnus implements a connector for context data coming from Orion Context Broker and aimed to be stored in a specific persistent storage, such as HDFS, CKAN or MySQL. Steelskin PEP is a proxy meant to secure Orion Context Broker, by intercepting every request sent to the Orion, validating it against the Access Control component.\n\n Why you get \n\nIf you are developing a Data/Context scenario, a broker like the Orion Context Broker is a must. You would need a component in the architecture able to mediate between consumer producers (e.g. sensors) and the context consumer applications (e.g. an smartphone applications taking advantage of the context information provided by the sensors). The Orion Context Broker fulfils this functionality in your architecture.\n", "enabler": "Publish/Subscribe Context Broker - Orion Context Broker", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       Latest      \n        Updated:       2016-12-09      \n        Contact Person:       Ask in Stack Overflow with tag fiware-orion      \n            -      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Excellent \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very Good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       1900 updates/sec \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Under review, soon to be provided \n       - \n     \n   \n \n      "},
{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/network-information-and-control-ofnic", "text": "What you get \nOFNIC is a reliable and distributed Software Defined Network (SDN) controller for enterprises\u2019 OpenFlow-enabled network. It enables the abstraction and virtualization of network resources and functionalities. It offers a RESTful interface in order to get information about the network topology components and elements either real or virtual. OFNIC also monitors the status of the network and provides near real-time data about network statistics with different levels of granularity (flow, node, port). Moreover it is capable of controlling the network forwarding capabilities and thus it is able to establish end-to-end paths with given quality of service/experience (QoS/QoE) requirements between any two nodes in the network.\n\n Why to get \nA customer wants to transfer a big amount of data to a certain end-point in the network. The data is located at one or multiple locations in the network. To get the data fast enough for his needs and in a reliable way, the customer wants to establish paths with certain requirements between the locations where his data is going to be transferred. In order to establish these guaranteed connections, the customer provides to the OFNIC GEi the list of source and destination endpoints and receives the response regarding the establishment of the required paths. Later the customer can manage his paths by modifying or releasing them on the basis of his needs. After the setup of the required paths, the customer could be interested in the monitoring of their status(i.e. the customer could be interested in the degree of utilization of the paths, or in the error rate on them, etc.), and the customer will have access to a number of statistics about the paths.\n\nRegarding the market position a brief consideration can be done. In the software defined networks paradigms there are many solutions which provide various network controllers and the competition is very high. Despite of this, part of them succeed in providing a clear definition of the northbound interface. The northbound interface is the one that enables the communication of the controller with the applications world. Moreover the network which they control differs from one case to another offering different functionalities and thus also the API exposed is fragmented. The main advantage of the SDN paradigm is to bring together the network world with the applications world. OFNIC realization is based on the NetIC Open Specifications and thus application developed specifically for emerging Openflow networks can be deployed for other GEi that are installed on top of other networks but have been developed their interface in line with the NetIC Open specifications.\n\n Open Specifications \nOFNIC is an open source, reference implementation of the FIWARE  NetIC   Generic Enabler. More specifically, OFNIC implements the following APIs and Open Specifications related to Openflow networks controlling:\nSee  FIWARE.OpenSpecification.I2ND.NetIC  for more information about NetIC open specifications.\nSee  FIWARE.OpenSpecification.I2ND.NetIC.RESTfulAPI  for more information about NetIC open API specifications.\n\n\n IMPORTANT NOTE \nThis GE reference implementation product is only of interest to potential FIWARE instance providers and therefore has been used to build the basic FIWARE platform core infrastructure of the FIWARE Lab.   If you are an application developer, you don't need to create a complete FIWARE instance locally in order to start building applications based on FIWARE.   You may rely on instances of FIWARE GEris linked to the Data/Media Context Management chapter, the IoT Services Enablement chapter, the Advanced Web-based User Interface chapter or some GEris of the Applications/Services Ecosystem and Delivery Framework chapter (WireCloud) as well as the Security chapter (Access Control).   Those instances are either global instances or instances you can create on the FIWARE Lab but can also be instance you can create by means of downloading, installing and configuring the corresponding software in your own premises.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE PPP Testbed (available to FIWARE PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n\n \n Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (http://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fiware.org)\n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name  orion-psb-image-R n  (where  n  is an image version number, such as 4.1).\n \n\nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n\nNote that orion-psb-image-R n  include not only Orion Context Broker but also other useful software related with it, such as Cygnus, the Orion PEP proxy and Rush. The RPMs installed in the image could be older than the most recent ones at FIWARE RPM reposiory, so it is strongly recommended that you update to the latest versions (read the welcome message upon SSH login for details).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\nThe  Orion Context Broker  can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can go to the Instance tab and press the \u201cAdd software\u201d button to automatically install the GE (called  orion ) and additional software from the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to deploy software using recipes are available on a tutorial available on http://lab.fiware.org\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \n\nThere may be Blueprint Templates associated to this GE in the catalogue of available FIWARE Blueprint Templates. The  orion-cb-sa  can be used as the basis for your own Blueprint Template or to extend the Blueprint Template you are defining for your own applications. The  orion-cb-sa  automates the deployment of a dedicated GE instance on top of several VMs via Chef recipes defined for  orion  in the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available from a tutorial available on http://lab.fiware.org\n\n Using the  Docker  container \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe Dockerfile can be found  here .\n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here .\n\n\n", "enabler": "Publish/Subscribe Context Broker - Orion Context Broker", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       Latest      \n        Updated:       2016-12-09      \n        Contact Person:       Ask in Stack Overflow with tag fiware-orion      \n            -      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Excellent \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very Good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       1900 updates/sec \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Under review, soon to be provided \n       - \n     \n   \n \n      "},

CEF eDelivery helps users to exchange electronic data and documents with one another in a reliable and trusted way. The CEF eDelivery solution is based on a distributed model called the \u201c4-corner model\u201d. In this model, the back-end systems of the users don\u2019t exchange data directly with each other but do this through Access Points. These Access Points are conformant to the same technical specifications and therefore capable of communicating with each other. As a result of this, users adopting CEF eDelivery can easily and safely exchange data even if their IT systems were developed independently from each other. \n\n Why to get it  \n\neDelivery helps to achieve the following goals: \n\n \n Interoperability:  Implementing common technical specifications that enable diverse organisations to exchange data and documents. \n Security:  Promoting an atmosphere of trust among all participants in the message exchange network. \n Scalability and Performance:  Enabling the number of participants in the data exchange network to grow as well as the number of exchanged messages. \n Legal Assurance and Accountability:  Promoting a high level of transparency and confidence among all participants in the message exchange network. \n  \n\nRe-using CEF eDelivery will accelerate the delivery time of a working document and data exchange network and reduces the cost and risk of creating, maintaining and operating such a network.

For those service providers,  the data analysis is not a goal itself but providing ways others can perform such data analysis . This especially applies to Openstack's Sahara installation. \n\n If you are a data scientist willing to get some insights on certain data; or you are a software engineer in charge of productizing an application based on a previous data scientist analysis, then please visit the User and Programmer Guide; and/or go directly to the FIWARE Lab Global Instances of Cosmos and/or Sinfonier, there you will find an already deployed infrastructure ready to be used through the different APIs. \n\n If you don't relay on FIWARE Lab Global Instances of Cosmos and/or Sinfonier and you want to use Hadoop and of Storm, do not install them; that will be as installing a complete Cloud just for creating a single virtual machine.

The Proactive Technology Online is a scalable integrated platform to support the development, deployment, and maintenance of event-driven applications. While standard reactive applications are based on reactions to single events, the Proton engine component reacts to situations rather than to single events. A situation is a condition that is based on a series of events that have occurred within a dynamic time window called a processing context. Situations include composite events (e.g., sequence), counting operators on events (e.g., aggregation) and absence operators.\nThe Proton engine is a run-time tool that receives information on the occurrence of events from event producers, detects situations, and reports the detected situations to external consumers.\n\n \n User and Programmers Guide \nThe Proactive Technology Online User Guide explains how to create a complex event processing (CEP) application. It describes the language constructs that are used to build CEP applications and includes tutorial that explains how this can be done using the Proactive Technology Onlineauthoring tool.\n\n\n \nThe Programmer Guide presents the Proton engine which is a run time component of the Proactive Technology Onlineasset. The programmer guide includes the high level architecture of the engine, the various supported adapters that can be used by the event producers to send events to the engine and the various supported adapters that can be used to send derived events from the engine to the consumers. It describes how a built-in adapter type can be used and how a new adapter type can be added. Configuration information and running instructions are also included.\n \n\n \nThe User and Programmers Guide can be found in the  FIWARE Wiki  or in  ReadTheDocs .\n \n\nProton CEP implements an API as follows:  CEP.API .\n\n Installation and Administration Guide \n\nThe Installation and Administration Guide can be found in the  FIWARE Wiki  or in  ReadTheDocs .\n\n Tutorials \nCheck out the course available from the FIWARE eLearning platform under  CEP GE .\n", "enabler": "Complex Event Processing (CEP) - Proactive Technology Online", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       Version 5      \n        Updated:       2016-08-07      \n        Contact Person:       Uri Shani      \n            SHANI@il.ibm.com   \n\n\n     IBM Haifa Research Lab\n\n\n      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured.

There are instructions and scripts in the  CEP Puppet  page that allows you to deploy a VM with  puppet  agent on which you can load and run a CEP server. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities of puppet.\n \n \n Deploying Using the Docker container  which is the most simple and convenient to have a working CEP in minutes.

{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/identity-management-keyrock", "text": "What you Get \nIdentity Management covers a number of aspects involving users' access to networks, services and applications, including secure and private authentication from users to devices, networks and services, authorization & trust management, user profile management, privacy-preserving disposition of personal data, Single Sign-On (SSO) to service domains and Identity Federation towards applications. The Identity Manager is the central component that provides a bridge between IdM systems at connectivity-level and application-level.\n\nFurthermore, Identity Management is used for authorising foreign services to access personal data stored in a secure environment. Hereby usually the owner of the data must give consent to access the data; the consent-giving procedure also implies certain user authentication.\n\n\n Why to Get it \nIdentity Management is key on any architecture. IdM offers tools for administrators to support the handling of user life-cycle functions. It reduces the effort for account creation and management, as it supports the enforcement of policies and procedures for user registration, user profile management and the modification of user accounts. Administrators can quickly configure customized pages for the inclusion of different authentication providers, registration of tenant applications with access to user profile data and the handling of error notifications. For end users, the IdM provides a convenient solution for registering with applications since it gives them a means to re-use attributes like address, email or others, thus allowing an easy and convenient management of profile information.

For example, it is possible to prove to the authenticating party that you have a valid credential without revealing it. Or that the name on the credential is the same as the name on your passport, again without revealing the name on the passport.\n\nThe GEri consists of three RESTful services:\n\n \n   The issuer service, which issues credentials. This needs to be deployed only once. \n   The verifier service, which issues presentation policies and which verifies that presentation tokens comply with those policies. This needs to be deployed once per resource owner. \n   The user service,  which connects to both issuers and verifiers and which computes presentation tokens from credentials and presentation policies. Needs to be deployed once per user. \n \n\nRead more about the Privacy GE in this  readme .\n\n Why to get it \n\nIf you run a service that is open only to authenticated users, but where you don't need a user's full identity every time they access your service or your resources, this GE may be for you. If you view the increasing number of break-ins and thefts of customer databases from major retailers with growing unease, this GE may be a profitable part of your strategy to curtail the value of such thefts. If you agree that the only way to prevent the misuse of large databases is not to have the data in the first place, but if you still want to make sure that users of your services are properly authenticated, this GE may be for you.\n\n Open Specification", "enabler": "Privacy", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:       4.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-08-02      \n        Contact Person:       Stephan Neuhaus      \n            stephan.neuhaus@zhaw.ch      \n            Incubated GEs/GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/synchronization", "text": "What you get \n\nThe Synchronization Generic Enabler presents a lightweight and generic network-synchronized dynamic scene data model, and two communication protocols to interact with the model: SceneAPI, a RESTful HTTP API for non-realtime querying and modification of the scene, and a WebSocket-based bidirectional protocol for connected Web clients to receive continuous real-time scene updates, and to post their real-time changes to the scene. It includes a server reference implementation based on the realXtend Tundra SDK, and a JavaScript client library.\n\nThe scene data model is based on a hierarchy of Entities, Components and Attributes. A typical use case would be the implementation of a dynamic multi-user virtual world, but as the data model is completely generic, it is by no means limited to that use case.\n\n Why to get it \n\nInstead of having to implement a custom data synchronization solution for a networked Web application, utilizing the Synchronization GE gives a ready-made synchronization solution. The WebSocket protocol is appropriate for receiving low-latency, real-time updates, such as the movement of objects in a virtual world. In cases where real-time updates are not needed, an external service can use the SceneAPI and standard HTTP requests without having to rely on a custom network protocol.\n\n Source code \n\n https://github.com/realXtend/tundra.git (4.4.3) \n https://github.com/realXtend/tundra-urho3d (5.4.3) \n", "enabler": "Synchronization", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:       5.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-09-19      \n        Contact Person:       Lasse \u00d6\u00f6rni [LudoCraft]      \n            email: lasse dot oorni at ludocraft dot com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

Web applications will be able to create, display and animate virtual characters. The characters can be composed of multiple mesh parts, to eg. allow easily swappable parts like upper or lower bodies, and attached objects such as clothing.\n\nThe virtual character functionality is implemented as a JavaScript library, and is part of the WebTundra codebase, which also contains the 3D-UI and Synchronization (client part) GE's. The 3D-UI GE (which in turn uses the WebGL API through the  three.js  rendering library) is utilized for the Entity-Component-Attribute based scene model, the hierarchical transformation graph and implementing the actual rendering: a virtual character becomes part of the scene hierarchy and can be manipulated using the scene model's functions.\n\n Why to get it \n\nUsing the Virtual Characters GE allows to quickly get into animating 3D characters in a Web Application. By also using the Synchronization GE which is contained in the same codebase, multi-user networked experiences such as virtual worlds can be created.\n\n Source code \n\n http://github.com/realXtend/WebTundra/ \n", "enabler": "Virtual Characters", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:       3.3      \n        Updated:       2016-01-13      \n        Contact Person:       Lasse \u00d6\u00f6rni [LudoCraft]      \n            lasse dot oorni at ludocraft dot com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},
{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/real-virtual-interaction", "text": "What do you get \n\nA key aspect of Augmented Reality is that virtual content is not just presented embedded within the context of the real world, but that it should also allow users to interact actively with real objects and the objects to provide input to the user. An example is a real object that visualizes its internal (non-visible) state overlaid on the real object using AR techniques. The user can then affect the real object by interacting with the virtual object using multi-touch gestures, which are relayed to the real object using services. Many of the necessary tools are available by the other topics in this GE (e.g. presentation of overlaid content, services to modify the state of the UI, services calls initiated from UI components). This higher-level GE deals with defining the aspects necessary to put them together and provide any necessary missing components and glue them together. \n\n Why to get it \n\nReal Virtual Interaction generic enabler (GE) provides means for connecting real world devices consisting of sensors and actuators in to augmented or virtual reality applications. Since the real world sensors and actuators are not complex enough to contain necessary logic to publish themselves outside their immediate domain there needs to be a external service that is able to access these devices and to be able to share the access to other services and also directly to end-users. This service provides security, data base for storing history and offline data, scalability and other cloud-like features that make it easier for application and service developers to make use of the devices in various purposes. This GE also provides a practical prototype for publishing sensor and actuator information application developers derived from NGSI 9/10 format developed earlier in FIWARE. \n\n Open specification reference \nThis component has been designed according the  Real Virtual Interaction GE Open Specification .", "enabler": "Real Virtual Interaction", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2016-06-21      \n        Contact Person:       Cyberlightning      \n            contact@cyberlightning.com      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

The GE implementation is based on open source Geoserver project (GPL licenced) and W3DS extension.\n\nUsing the GE consists of two phases. \n \n  Import the geodata into the GIS database into selected layer structure\n  serve the data from the imported layers as client requests\n \n\nGIS GE does not restrict the layerstucture nor the datatypes what is being imported into the database. Hence, the GE does not provide import tools universally for all dataformats in the world. As a reference, a dataset from Finnish geographical institute is provided to show how geodata is imported. Using this example it is easy to extend the import process to any dataset you might possess.\n\n Why to get it \n\"3D GIS (Geographic Information System) data provider\" is a GE, which is able to serve both outdoor and indoor 3D data. The data shall be served roughly speaking in two fashions:\n \n For single user apps, which can make queries to GIS backend, to download specific a single object, or a set of geolocated 3D objects (i.e. building and terrain model of a named city centre)\n For multiuser apps, which communicate via collaborative client platform (realXTend) and in which case the realXtend is providing the 3D models for the client application. \n \nThe GIS GE itself will be build of a server, which is able to process geolocated queries, an extension to it which is able to manage 3D data and a backend database where all geolocated data is saved. Because the GIS GE needs to serve both single user client apps (browsers) and multiuser enabled virtual spaces, an API will be defined to serve fluently both of the cases. In this API is a RESTful one, and allows both the browser app as well as realXtend virtual world platform to use it for downloading geolocated data.

Furthermore, this is the component that every GEis are including on top of their REST APIs so it is tested and used in many different scenarios.  \n\n Open Specification \n\n", "enabler": "PEP Proxy - Wilma", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:       4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-10-21      \n        Contact Person:       Alvaro Alonso      \n            aalonsog@dit.upm.es      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n Wilma \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       2,3 days \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       10 days \n       A \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       1126,25 proxy requests per second \n       A+ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory/CPU keep stable  \n       A+++ \n     \n   \n \n      "},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).\n\nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent.

CKAN is aimed at data publishers (national and regional governments, companies and organizations) wanting to make their data open and available. \n\n Features include: \n \n Complete catalog system with easy to use web interface and a powerful API \n Strong integration with third-party CMS\u2019s like Drupal and WordPress \n Data visualization and analytics \n Workflow support lets departments or groups manage their own data publishing \n Fine-grained access control \n Integrated data storage and full data API \n Federated structure: easily set up new instances with common search \n \n\n Why to get it \n\n Data creates value. Governments do not have to provide all services around data themselves. They can empower citizens, organisations, and companies to make use of the data in new ways and unlock a lot of value for everyone. A  McKinsey Global Institute Report  estimates that access and re-usability of data across seven sectors of government can unlock between $3 trillion and $5 trillion in economic value annually. \n\n CKAN helps governments national and local, to unlock this value. CKAN is an open source platform which means it can be easily adapted and expanded, there are no upfront capital licensing costs. In addition, CKAN-based solutions eliminate the risk of lock-in to a sole vendor and ensures the opportunity to source support, customization and hosting from multiple providers going forward. \n\n Open Specification Reference \n\n The Open Specification of the GE can be found via the FIWARE website ( architecture  and  API specification ).", "enabler": "CKAN", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       2.5      \n        Updated:       2016-03-30      \n        Contact Person:       ckan-fiware@okfn.org      \n            This is an email alias that goes to a number of people within Open Knowledge, the organisation that originally developed CKAN and continue to support it.

The User Portal is implemented in a form of a Web GUI following the same functionality as the OpenStack Dashboard. All about the implementation and the functionality of the OpenStack Dashboard can be found under the Horizon project. The Scripts facilitate direct approach to the underlying cloud resources through a command line and is addressed for administrators.\n\n Why to Get it \nThe Self Services Interfaces is divided in two parts: User Portal and Toolkit.\n \n The User Portal is implemented in a form of a Web GUI following the example of the portals that today's common cloud infrastructure managers like Amazon EC2, Eucalyptus,Cloud Sigma, Rackspace, etc. have. In concrete it bases its design principles on the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard. The basic objective of the user portal is to facilitate the user of the cloud perform operations over the underlying infrastructure. This includes perform actions such as: create user, manage projects, lunch instances on a base of images, create images in the image repository, retrieve flavors from the resource, etc. Moreover the portal facilitates management of a Virtual Data centers (VDCs), Services and Service Data Centers (SDCs), PaaS management and will offer monitoring statistics of the physical and virtual machines. \n The Toolkit is aimed for administrators and experienced users and it consist of various scripts that permit to perform the same actions the user portal does and some more advanced options. \n \n\n Open Specification \n", "enabler": "Self Service Interfaces - Cloud Portal", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Cloud Hosting      \n        Version:       5.3      \n        Updated:       2016-08-02      \n        Contact Person:       \u00c1lvaro Alonso      \n            aalonsog@dit.upm.es      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).\n\nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n\nFor this particular generic enabler instance the available deployment methods are as follows:\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n\n \n   Access the  FIWARE Cloud Portal \n   Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on  FIWARE Account Portal ) \n   Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name \"cloud-portal-image\" \n \n\nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\nWilma can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can go to the Instance tab and press the \u201cAdd software\u201d button to automatically install the GE (called cloud-portal) and additional software from the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to deploy software using recipes are available on a tutorial available on  FIWARE Lab Portal \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n\n Using the  Docker  container  \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe Dockerfile can be found  here \n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here \n", "enabler": "Self Service Interfaces - Cloud Portal", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Cloud Hosting      \n        Version:       5.3      \n        Updated:       2016-08-02      \n        Contact Person:       \u00c1lvaro Alonso      \n            aalonsog@dit.upm.es      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},
{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/policy-manager-bosun", "text": "What you get \nThe Policy Manager GE provides the basic management of cloud resources based on rules, as well as management of the corresponding resources within the FIWARE Cloud Instance like actions based on physical monitoring or infrastructure, security monitoring of resources and services or whatever that could be defined by a facts, actions and rules. Policy Manager is an easy rule engine designed to be used in the OpenStack ecosystem and of course inside the FIWARE Cloud.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This GE reference implementation product is only of interest to potential FIWARE instance providers and therefore has been used to build the basic FIWARE platform core infrastructure of the FIWARE Lab. If you are an application developer, you don't need to create a complete FIWARE instance locally in order to start building applications based on FIWARE. You may rely on instances of FIWARE GEris linked to the Data/Media Context Management chapter, the IoT Services Enablement chapter, the Advanced Web-based User Interface chapter or some GEris of the Applications/Services Ecosystem and Delivery Framework chapter (WireCloud) as well as the Security chapter (Access Control). Those instances are either global instances or instances you can create on the FIWARE Lab but can also be instance you can create by means of downloading, installing and configuring the corresponding software in your own premises.\u00a0\n\n \n Why to get it \nOpenStack is an amazing open source software to manage the available infrastructure provided. Nevertheless, there is a lack related to the management of actions related to the monitoring data. Cloud administrator should make lots of forensic activities due to infrastructure or software problems that might be automatically resolved if an appropriate monitoring information should be received on time. This problem means a chronophage both cloud administrators and cloud users with the consequent money losses and credibility of the cloud solution. Policy Manager resolve this issue by defining a set of rules associated to the monitoring facts in order that cloud administrator does not lose their time on some forensic activities.\n\nBy using Policy Manager you have access to the following key features:\n \n Innovate through experimentation by choosing the best suited rule engine, rule definition and high architecture solution to manage high reception of facts in real time. \n Rules management whose target is to hire rules defined by the cloud administrator and/or cloud user. \n Populate rule engine with facts collected from the data context. \n Facts management related to servers and/or hosts. \n Rules evaluation on real time. \n \n", "enabler": "Policy Manager - Bosun", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Cloud Hosting      \n        Version:       5.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-11-04      \n        Contact Person:       Fernando Lopez      \n            fernando dot lopezaguilar at telefonica dot com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n Bosun \n \n \n   \n     criteria \n     value \n     label \n   \n \n \n   \n     The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n   \n \n \n   \n     Documentation completeness \n     Fair \n     A \n   \n   \n     Documentation soundness \n     Good \n     A+ \n   \n   \n     APIs Failure Rate \n     0,06 tests failed/executed \n     A++ \n   \n   \n     Detected defects by Priority \n     1 average bugs priority \n     A++ \n   \n   \n     Time to respond issues \n     < 1 day \n     A+++ \n   \n   \n     Time to fix issues \n     1 day \n     A++ \n   \n   \n     Scalability \n     1,02 response time/thread number \n     A+++ \n   \n   \n     Performance \n     200 updates/sec \n     A+++ \n   \n   \n     Stability \n     Memory leak avoidable by configuration \n     B \n   \n   \n \n      "},
{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/docker", "text": "What you get \n \nThe Docker GE provides the basic docker container hosting capabilities, as well as management of the corresponding resources within the Data Center that hosts a particular FIWARE Docker Container Service (FDCS) Instance. It will ensure that FIWARE developers can leverage the docker ecosystem to create services composed of FIWARE GEs and deploy them on FIWARE Cloud compliant providers. To that end the Docker GE exposes the docker API on FIWARE and allows FIWARE developers to easily host their docker containers on the FIWARE Lab nodes or on their own on-premise FDCS.\n \n\n \nWhile users can use the Cloud Portal GE to interact with their docker hosts, the Docker GE also ensures that they can remotely create and manage their docker hosts, clusters and containers from their local docker clients.\n \n\n \nThe Docker GE shows how developers can leverage Docker Machine to deploy and manage docker hosts on the FIWARE lab.\n \n\n \nMore importantly, the Docker GE provides a service that relieves users from managing their own Docker hosts. Instead it introduces the FIWARE Docker Container Service (FDCS) which will allows users to focus solely on managing their containers in a secure environment. In addition to exposing the regular Docker capabilities FDCS provides authorization and authentication capabilities which allows it to support tenant isolation between different FIWARE accounts. The multi-tenant Docker support is integrated with FIWARE Keystone service and its existing accounts definitions. \nThe service also provides support for name scoping between tenants such that tenants can use the same docker resource names without interfering with each other.\n \n\n \nFDCS is deployed as on the FIWARE Lab so users can get its benefits by simply applying for admission to the service.\nAlternatively, FDCS can be installed on-premises so a site can deploy docker containers on their private FDCS cluster.  \n\n\n The main capabilities provided by FDCS are: \n \n  Multi-tenancy (support isolation between Contains of different accounts) \n   Name scoping (the same docker resource name can be used between tenants without interfering with each other )\n Manage life cycle Docker Hosts\n Manage network and storage attached Docker Hosts\n Resource monitoring of Docker Hosts\n Resiliency of the persistent data associated with Docker Hosts\n Manage resource allocation\n Secure access to the Docker Hosts\n Secure access to the Docker Containers \n \n\n Why to get it \n\n Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run applications. Docker lets you quickly assemble applications from components and eliminates the friction that can come when shipping code. Docker lets you get your code tested and deployed into production as fast as possible.\n \n \nThe Docker GE allows you take advantage of Docker to create FIWARE based services\nand easily host them in the FIWARE cloud.\nIt exposes the  Docker API .\n \n\n", "enabler": "Docker", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Cloud Hosting      \n        Version:       1.19      \n        Updated:       2016-08-11      \n        Contact Person:       Kenneth Nagin      \n            nagin@il.ibm.com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

The functionality provided by the FIWARE Business Framework will be offered by the new Business API Ecosystem GE, which will be released in the release 5 of FIWARE \n\n What you get \n\n Service Business Frameworks (SBFs) represent one of the cornerstones of service ecosystems. The key objective of a SBF is to build and support an ecosystem of applications and services that is sustainable and fosters innovation as well as cross-fertilization. In particular, it consists of a number of interrelated components that support managing services in the business framework across the whole service lifecycle: from creation and composition of services to monetization and revenue sharing.  \n\n One key component of the SBF provided by FI-WARE is a Store for selling services to both consumers and developers of Future Internet applications and services and for end-to-end managing of offerings and sales. \n\n While a marketplace is a platform for many stores to place their offerings to a broader audience and consumers to search and compare services and find the store where to buy, a store is owned by a store owner who has full control over a specific service/app portfolio and offerings. The final business transaction (buying) is done at the store and the whole back office process (end-to-end managing of offerings and sales) is handled by the store. \n\n By using the WStore GEri you have access to the following key features: \n \n Support for accounting callbacks \n Support for rich pricing models (including pricing parts for service compositions, composite apps and mashups, pay-per-use modalities, etc.) \n Support for charging \n Support for billing \n Support for revenue sharing \n Integrated support for PayPal \n Support for the FIWARE Marketplace, Repository and Revenue Sharing GEs \n Support for the linked-USDL standard \n Integrated with the WireCloud GEri by design  \n \n\n Note:  The Business Framework in general, and the WStore GEri in particular, are at the core of the FIWARE infrastructure and are therefore intended to be installed by FIWARE platform providers when setting up and configuring a new instance of the FIWARE instance node. They are not intended to be deployed/configured by a developer. Developers are encouraged to use  the global instance of the WStore provided in the FIWARE Lab . Nevertheless, we provide an installer for stand-alone instances of the WStore, along with recipes and blueprints to install it in the Cloud portal (using the PaaS Manager), and the corresponding installation guides. \n\n Why to get it \n\n The design of the Store generic enabler does not focus on consumer-centric mobile apps, but on selling enterprise-level apps and cloud services that will leverage the FIWARE platform in general and its business framework in particular. Its integrated support for pricing (including pay-per-use modalities), accounting, charging, billing and revenue sharing will position it one step ahead of the current market. \n\n Open Specifications \n\nWStore is an open source, reference implementation of the FIWARE  Store  Generic Enabler. More specifically, WStore implements the following APIs and Open Specifications related to the FIWARE Business Framework: \n \n See  FIWARE.OpenSpecification.Apps.Store  for more information on the Store Open Specification. \n See  Store API  for a detailed description of the Store Open RESTful API Specification \n", "enabler": "Store - WStore", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       4.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-09-27      \n        Contact Person:       Francisco de la Vega      \n            Email: \nfdelavega@fi.upm.es\n\nAddress:\nSchool of Computer Science\nUniversidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid\nCampus de Montegancedo s/n\n28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},
{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/revenue-settlement-and-sharing-system-rss-ri", "text": "This GE is in support mode, which means that this GE won't have further evolution, being offered and supported in its current version (Release 4 of FIWARE). The functionality provided by the FIWARE Business Framework will be offered by the new Business API Ecosystem GE, which will be released in the release 5 of FIWARE \n\n What you get \n\n The Revenue Settlement and Sharing System (RSS) GE is in charge of distributing the revenues originated by the usage of a given service among the involved stakeholders. In particular, it focuses on distributing part of the revenue generated by a service between the Store Provider and the Service Provider(s) responsible for the service. With the term \"service\" we refer to both final applications and backend application services (typically exposed through an API). Note that, in the case of composite services, more than one service provider may have to receive a share of the revenues. \n\n Revenue sharing is based on a set of business models (revenue sharing models) which dictate how to distribute revenues. The RSS GE is fed, via available APIs, with these models and additional information regarding service providers. In addition, Charging Data Records (CDRs), based on service usage information, are periodically fed to the RSS GE to enable the revenue sharing process. CDRs must be created by another GE (e.g., the Store GE) and/or external system based on per service specified price models and accounting information.  \n\n Different revenue sharing models can be assigned to Service Providers, each of them based on a combination of parameters such as product class or the Store that offers the service. For instance, the revenue sharing model used to calculate payments to a given Service Provider for music may be different from the one used for applications.   \n\n The RSS GE exposes an API for other components to send charging information and to manage revenue sharing models. It also features a GUI which can be used by RSS and Store administrators to manage revenue sharing models, access reporting information and perform additional administration tasks.  \n\n Additionally to this functionality the RSS GE offers the possibility to consult reports, regarding the CDR received, to both RSS and Store administrators. Example of these reports can be the quantity of amounts received in a period, number of transactions per application provider, or information regarding the most purchased applications. \n\n Finally as a supplementary functionality, expenditure limits functionality is offered in this GE. The expenditure limit API provides a mechanism through which an application provider can limit the amount of money spent by a customer using the services, along a specific time interval. Once this limit is exceeded, it will not be possible to purchase anything until next period of time.  \n\n This API exposes the functionality that a provider will use to check the balance and accumulated expenses of a given customer, previously to accept a purchase.  \n\n The RSS GE is part of FIWARE's Business Framework and thus can work in close cooperation with other GEs like the Store GE. However, it can also work in a standalone way. \n\nMain capabilities offered include:\n \n Storage of trading transactions \n Definition of revenue sharing models \n Revenue settlement \n Revenue reporting capabilities \n Expenditure control management \n \n\nFor more details, see:  RSS GE description  \n\n Why to get it \n\n The RSS GE offers advanced revenue management capabilities which enable the proper monetization of your applications and services. Together with the rest of the FIWARE's business framework GEs, it creates a powerful trading environment which will help you reach and interact with a large amount of customers while requiring very little effort from your side. In addition, sophisticated analytics and reporting tools will help you better understand customers behaviour and business trends.", "enabler": "Revenue Settlement and Sharing System - RSS RI", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       4.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-09-27      \n        Contact Person:       Francisco de la Vega      \n            fdelavega@conwet.com      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

In this regard, the Business API Ecosystem GE is a joint component made up by integrating the FIWARE Business Framework with a set of standard APIs (and its reference implementations) provided by the TMForum in its TMF API ecosystem. \n\n This component allows the monetization of different kind of assets (both digital and physical) during the whole service life cycle, from offering creation to its charging, accounting and revenue settlement and sharing. In this way, the Business API Ecosystem provides sellers the means for managing, publishing, and generating revenue of they products, apps, data, and services. \n\n  By using the Business API Ecosystem you have access to the following key features: \n \n     Support for the management of catalogs, products, and offering \n     Support for rich pricing models, including recurring payments, pay-per-use, etc. \n     Support for accounting callbacks \n     Support for billing and charging \n     Integrated support for PayPal, including customer charges and seller payments \n     Support for revenue sharing, including models with multiple stakeholders involved \n \n\n The Business API Ecosystem exposes its complete functionality through TMForum standard APIs; concretely, it includes the catalog management, ordering management, inventory management, usage management, billing, customer, and party APIs. \n\n Why to get it \n\n In those fields where it is expected to create a real ecosystem of apps, data, and services (such as Smart Cities), offering third parties a way to enrich existing services and data, and enable monetization, is a key factor. In this regard, the integrated support for pricing (including pay-per-use modalities), accounting, charging, billing and revenue sharing offered by the Business API Ecosystem can position it one step ahead of the current market. \n\n Additionally, the TMForum APIs are design to enable repeatable and flexible integration among operations and management systems, making it easier to create, build and operate complex innovative services. The Business API Ecosystem exposes its functionality using the standard TMForum APIs; therefore, it takes advantage of the benefits on operation and management offered by such standards, allowing companies that plan to offer data and apps in such ecosystem to not adapt their systems ad-hoc. \n", "enabler": "Business API Ecosystem - Biz Ecosystem RI", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       5.4.0      \n        Updated:       2016-10-14      \n        Contact Person:       Francisco de la Vega      \n            Email: \nfdelavega@fi.upm.es\n\nAddress:\nSchool of Computer Science\nUniversidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid\nCampus de Montegancedo s/n\n28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (http://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fiware.org)\n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name  SpagoBI .\n \n\nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\n SpagoBI  GEri can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. SpagoBI Chef recipes are available within the FIWARE Chef Server. Furthermore the recipes for bootstrap SpagoBI using Chef are  here . \nIt's also possible to install SpagoBI into an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, using this command:\n \ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpagoBILabs/SpagoBI/master/ChefCookbooks/installation.sh | ssh -i [identity file] [sudo user]@[ip of machine]\n \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \n\nThere may be Blueprint Templates associated to this GE in the catalogue of available FIWARE Blueprint Templates. The  spagobi  tier can be used as the basis for your own Blueprint Template or to extend the Blueprint Template you are defining for your own applications. The  spagobi  tier automates the deployment of a dedicated GE instance on top of several VMs via Chef recipes in the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available on  http://help.lab.fiware.org .\n\n Using the  Docker  container \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here .", "enabler": "Data Visualization - SpagoBI", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       5.2.1      \n        Updated:       2016-10-17      \n        Contact Person:       Davide Zerbetto      \n            Email: davide.zerbetto@eng.it      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-management-idas", "text": "What you get \n\nThe IDAS component is an implementation of the    Backend Device Management GE . \n \nIts main usage is the    Typical IoT use-case Scenario I: Common Simple Scenario  of the    overall FIWARE IoT architecture .\n \n \nAs of May 2016, IDAS has been totally refactored according to the feedback provided by FIWARE Developer community. \n \nConcretely, the new IDAS (Release 5 onwards) provides: \n \n All IoT Agents are now coded with node.js and therefore the installation, configuration and new development processes have been simplified and optimized. \n  The IoT Agents are not classified anymore by the transport technology (e.g: HTTP, MQTT, CoAP) but they are distributed in different GIT repositories based on the top level (device semantics) protocol and offering different trasnport possibilities. This means that thre is an Ultralight2.0 IoT Agent with different trasnport options (currently HTTP or MQTT) that may be increased in the future (e.g. supporting CoAP in the forthcomming Sprints).\nYou will select and use only those IoT Agents supporting the IoT semantics and trasnport protocol your devices/gateways actually use. \n The IoT Agent Manager component delivered at Release 4 is still not available with node.js and thefore it will be announced in the forthcoming sprints. This component addresses monitoring and management of IoT Agent instances. You only need this component for complex scenarios with multiple IoT Agent instances. \n The Northbound API of IDAS (i.e. all IoT Agents plus the IoT Manager) is the OMA NGSI protocol, as long as IoT Agents are normally expected to be connected to an NGSI Broker, such as the   Orion ContextBroker \n A Library for IoT Agents in node.js is provided for those IoT integrators willing to implement a new IoT specific standard/propietary protocol themselves. \n A  Reference client tool called FIGWAY to connect physical devices or experiment with virtual devices for simulation exercises using UL2.0/HTTP protocol. UL2.0 is an open and light protocol specification for devices. \n An IoT Edge Manager component is being implement in Release 5 onwards. Initially it stores and handles the communications and/or IoT-gateways topology and details as NGSI entities. This testing implementation is being developed as part of FIGWAY tool. In the future it may address more functions beyond storage/description related to IoT networks, IoT Gateways and IoT end-nodes operations. \n \n \n \n\n Why to get it \nYou need this component if you plan to connect IoT devices/gateways to FIWARE-based ecosystems. IDAS IoT Agents translate IoT-specific protocols into the NGSI context information protocol, that is the FIWARE standard data exchange model. You do not need this component if your devices or gateways natively support the NGSI API. \n \n \nBy using this component (in reality just the IoT Agents related to your devices IoT protocols), your devices will be represented in a FIWARE platform as NGSI entities in a ContextBroker. This means that you can query or subscribe to changes of device parameters status by querying or subscribing to the corresponding NGSI entity attributes at the ContextBroker.\n \n \nAdditionally, you may trigger commands to your actuation devices just by updating specific command-related attributes in their NGSI entities representation at the Contaxt Broker.\n \nThis way, all developers interactions with devices are handled at a ContextBroker, providing an homogeneous API and interface as for all other non-IoT data in a FIWARE ecosystem.\n \n \n\n Open specification reference \n\nIDAS component has been designed according the    BE Device Management   Open Specification.

{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/authorization-pdp-authzforce", "text": "What you get \n \nYou get the reference implementation of the Authorization PDP Generic Enabler (formerly called Access Control GE). Indeed, as mandated by the GE specification, this implementation provides an API to get authorization decisions based on authorization policies, and authorization requests from PEPs. The API follows the REST architecture style, and complies with XACML v3.0. XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) is a OASIS standard for authorization policy format and evaluation logic, as well as for the authorization decision request/response format. The PDP (Policy Decision Point) and the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) terms are defined in the XACML standard. This GEri plays the role of a PDP.\n \n \nTo fulfill the XACML architecture, you may need a PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) to protect your application, which is not provided here. For REST APIs, we recommend you use the  PEP Proxy by UPM available in the catalogue .\n \n\n Why to get it \nProviding authorization for your application is a must for security reasons. However, it is always a complex part to implement, especially for non-security developers, because it involves advanced security concepts (Identity-based, RBAC, ABAC, etc.). Most developers embed the authorization logic within the application code, which makes it hard to maintain, evolve and integrate with external services providing extra authorization attributes. In this regard, the Authorization PDP helps you externalize the authorization logic and take advantage of flexible and standard-compliant Attribute-Based Access Control features. Combined with the Identity Management GE and the PEP proxy, this gives you a comprehensive access control solution for your application.", "enabler": "Authorization PDP - AuthZForce", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:       5.4.1      \n        Updated:       2016-10-21      \n        Contact Person:       Cyril DANGERVILLE      \n            Contact \n (function(){var qs,js,q,s,d=document,gi=d.getElementById,ce=d.createElement,gt=d.getElementsByTagName,id='typef_orm',b='https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/share.typeform.com/';if(!gi.call(d,id)){js=ce.call(d,'script');js.id=id;js.src=b+'share.js';q=gt.call(d,'script')[0];q.parentNode.insertBefore(js,q)}})() \n\n      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n AuthZForce \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       9,2 days \n       A \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       9 days \n       A \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,15 response time/thread number \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       6853,58 authorization requests per second \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory/CPU are progressively increasing but no leak \n       A \n     \n   \n \n      "},

The key objective of a SBF is to build and support an ecosystem of applications and services that is sustainable and fosters innovation as well as cross-fertilization. In particular, it consists of a number of interrelated components that support managing services in the business framework across the whole service lifecycle: from creation and composition of services to monetization and revenue sharing. \n\n The Wirecloud (App Mashup) Monetization Bundle represents one of the uses cases of the Service Business Framework and intends to show the potential of the SBF features provided by FIWARE in a concrete use case. This use case is based on the use of the SBF to monetize the mashable application components used in Wirecloud. \n\n This bundle includes the set of GEis that support different monetization and revenue sharing features of SBFs plus the application that will be the client of those services: Wirecloud. The final list of the GEis included in this bundle is: \n\n \n     Marketplace RI (Marketplace GEi): This GEi is in charge of bringing together offering and demand allowing the publication and search of offerings that are offered in different Stores. The rketplace also includes some lateral functions such as review, rating and recommendation of offerings. \n\n     Repository RI (Repository GEi): This GEi provides a consistent uniform API to USDL service descriptions and associated media files for applications and services offered in the business famework. \n\n     WStore (Store GEi): While the marketplace is a platform for many stores to place their offerings to a broader audience and consumers to search and compare services and find the store where to buy, WStore GEi is in charge of the final business transaction (buying) and the whole back office process; that is, the end-to-end managing of offerings and sales including the charging of the customer. \n\n     RSS GEi: This GEi is in charge of distributing the revenues originated by the business transactions of a given application among several stakeholders involved. In particular, it focuses on sharing part of the revenue generated by an application between WStore GEi instance provider and the service provider(s) responsible for the offering.\n Note:  The RSS GE does not have a recipe, but it is available as a global instance in the FIWARE Lab. Therefore, the blueprint for this bundle does not configure this GEri.\nNevertheless, the user guide of the Store GEri (see Administration section) explains how to connect the Store to a RSS instance once it has been deployed (e.g through this blueprint) \n\n     Wirecloud (Application Mashup GEi): This GEi builds on cutting-edge end-user development, RIA and semantic technologies to offer a next-generation end-user centred web application Mashup platform aimed at leveraging the long tail of the Internet of Services. Web application mashups integrate heterogeneous data, application logic, and UI components (widgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherent and value-adding composite applications. Wirecloud uses the SBF functionalities for monetizing those components (widgets, operators and their composition: mashups). \n \n\n It is necessary to remark that this bundle requires to be deployed in a FIWARE instance since it requires an Identity Manager to work.

From the point of view of a service provider,  the usage scenario describes the creation and publication of an offering thought the different components involved. \n\n As a previous step, the service provider should register the different services to be offered in FIWARE instance Identity Manager (As stated in the Overview section, the deployment in a FIWARE instance is a requisite of the bundle to work properly) in order to allow the delegation of the access control. Note that this step is only necessary when the service provider is offering services. \n\n The next step consists on the registration of the different downloadable digital assets to be offered in WStore. To register this assets the service provider can use the Web interface provided. \n\n Once the digital assets to be offered have been registered, the next step consists on the creation of the offering in WStore using the web interface provided. To create the offering the service provider should include a USDL document of the offering and select the different services and downloadable assets previously registered. During this process WStore uploads the USDL description of the offering to the Repository. \n\n The final step consists on the publication of the offering. Since the offering has been created in WStore, its web interface can be used for the publication. When an offering has been published, it is included in the Marketplace in order to make them available to potential customers. \n\n From the point of view of a customer , the usage scenario describes the discovery, acquisition, charging and revenue sharing process. \n\n On a first step, the customer searches using the Marketplace service for an offering that fits her needs. Once she founds an offering, she is redirected to WStore where she can buy it and get charged. When the offering has been purchased, WStore downloads the downloadable digital assets and notifies the identity manager the purchase in order to give her the related roles for accessing the purchased service. \n\n Every time the customer is charged, WStore feeds the RSS with charging information that is used by this component in order to distribute the generated revenues between the different stakeholders of the offering. \n", "enabler": "Business Framework Consumption", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Version:       1.0      \n        Updated:       2014-11-18      \n        Contact Person:       Francisco de la Vega      \n            Email: fdelavega@fi.upm.es \r\nAddress: School of Computer Science Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid Campus de Montegancedo s/n 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)      "},

{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/fiware-ngsi10-testserver/documentation", "text": "Quick reference guide \n The FIWARE NGSI10 Testserver allows to test and analyze NGSI calls that are supposed to address a \"real\" Generic Enabler against a testing server that offers verbose output re. the validity of the NGSI client calls. Instead of directly accessing the GEs during development, you may choose to interact with the NGSI10 Test Server instead. When accessing the NGSI10 Test Server, it will then provide lots of useful information in the status field of the reply (which is human readable). The information provided by the NGSI10 Test Server is embedded in valid replies to server invocations (though it does not implement the fully-fledged NGSI functionality). You can also test if your client is able to fully understand and handle those valid replies. When you are done testing the NGSI10-based interaction with the NGSI10 Test Server, then you can swap out the test server and swap in the actual GE. \n To get an idea about typical responses, please navigate to  http://130.206.81.82:8080/NGSI10/contextEntities/my_house . \nMore detailed information can be found in the  User and Programmer Guide . \nA training course is available at  http://edu.fiware.org/course/view.php?id=60 .  \n Quickstart \n To get started, please navigate to  http://130.206.81.82:8080/NGSI10/contextEntities/my_house . The result will probably not be formatted nicely and hard to read. In order to get a prettier output, please install a REST client addon to your browser (see below). Then start the addon and, within the addon!, navigate to the URL given above. Make sure to specify GET as the request method. You should get a response with status code 200 (OK) and a response body that tells you all the context information available for \"my_house\", like this: \n <contextElementResponse xmlns:xsi=\"<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> \n\">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> \n</a>  <contextElement> \n    <entityId> \n      <id>my_house</id> \n        <!-- lots of context information about \"my house\" --> \n  </contextElement> \n  <statusCode> \n    <!-- lots of information about your request --> \n  </statusCode> \n</contextElementResponse> \n The statusCode element contains lot of information about your request that come in handy when debugging the request sent by you (and your software), such as the headers you sent (e.g. the MediaType and the query parameters). Now change the request method to POST and fire the request again. You should get a status code of 400 (Bad Request) with lots of information what went wrong. \n RESTful browser addons \n Google Chrome: \"Simple REST Client\" addon\n Mozilla Firefox: \"RESTClient addon \"\n Safari: \"RESTClient\" addon\n", "enabler": "FIWARE NGSI10 TestServer", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Tools      \n        Version:       1.0      \n        Updated:       2015-03-24      \n        Contact Person:       Oliver Kasten      \n            oliver.kasten@sap.com      \n                 \n        Feedback:            \n                 "},
